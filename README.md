### Hi there 👋

**NOTE** My more recent repositories with relevant code are currently private. Please get in touch if you are interested in viewing them. 

## About Me

I am a Senior Solutions Architect, based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I have almost 20 years of web development experience over various programming languages, having specialized in WordPress for the past 12 years. I work within the full-stack, including modern CSS (custom properties, PostCSS, CSS Grid), object-oriented PHP, and have a solid understanding of database optimization and DevOps (specifically CI/CD).

I've architected multiple WordPress sites, from the simplest brochure website, to a 2800+ WordPress Multisite network. Being Canadian, I have extensive experience with multilingual plugins. I've also developed plugins that interface with 3rd party APIs, and written extensive custom WP-CLI commands. 

While I understand that page builders such as Divi, Beaver Builder, and WP Bakery make sense, I am passionate for custom blocks. I can build blocks with either Advanced Custom Fields Pro, or native blocks using React.

I truly believe that development should be collaborative and compassionate, and that leadership should come from grace. Everyone can teach something to someone, regardless of how experienced an individual is.
